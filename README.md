# dotapps.io

The apps UI served via IPNS with dnslink. 

This site, deployed at https://dotapps.io just performs a redirect to the latest IPFS hash, as served via IPNS on https://ipfs.io/ipns/dotapps.io

In addition to the default ipfs.io gateway, alternatives are also provided (all ipns capable) -

- https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipns/dotapps.io
- https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipns/dotapps.io

The above can be exapnded based on user-preferences and feedback.
